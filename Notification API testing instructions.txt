-To test the technician notification functions, you have to add yourself to the database as a technician with your number in the correct format (for example +27123456789). 

-Then I have to verify your number on my twilio account (because thats what you have to do if you have a free trial account)

-Dont test the sms function, because that costs money and my twilio account only has $14.2214 on it (an sms costs about $1)

-You can test the whatsapp function all you want though 

-to do that, run the app and then go to https://localhost:7206/CallCenter/CallCenter and fill in the form

- i cant integrate an email api because sendgrid wont let me make an account 

-I cant hardcode api credentials because twilio picks up on it and revokes the auth token once i commit the code to the public github repo. I dont know how to fix this. so for now you have to manually add the credentials to the WhatsappNotificationServices.cs and SMSNotificationServices.cs files.

here are the credentials:
account Sid: ACc22a1cc2695739e39421d1ede151fcab
auth token: 221f39365bf3f2b7e33e275459bb56cd
